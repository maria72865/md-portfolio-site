                <p>
                    Maria is an “old school” developer who worked her way to a Bachelor's Degree in Computer 
                    Science by using what she was learning in school to create websites and develop software.  
                    The websites were created with HTML written in Notepad and were heavy on the graphics, 
                    which were created in Photoshop CS and Flash. She was passionate about developing, but 
                    living in Wichita, Kansas, known as the Air Capital of the World for all of the aircraft 
                    manufacturers in the area, it was inevitable that she would end up in the aviation industry. 
                    When an opportunity arose to work with the Federal Aviation Administration 
                    and be the first non-manufacturer company to issue Temporary RVSM Approvals, she took it. 
                    This is what began Premium RVSM Services, LLC.  Cessna kept her busy with their international 
                    business jet clients until two overseas manufacturers began producing business jets. Between 
                    the new competition and the recession/mortgage crisis, Cessna saw a sharp decrease in sales
                    and was forced to lay off over half of their workforce. Premium RVSM Services was hit hard and 
                    this took Maria on a journey that has finally circled back around to developing. She recently 
                    updated her skills through Bottega Tech’s Full Stack Web Engineer courses and worked as an 
                    apprentice student mentor/support tech for Bottega.  She is now the NW Kansas Tech Lead for Rural and Remote.<br><br>
                    She isn’t very good at proofreading her own work and her “can-do” attitude can be a little 
                    over the top at times, but her organizational and trouble-shooting skills will make her a valuable asset.  
                    She brings a lot to the table with her extensive experience with remote work and dedication 
                    to always do her best, as well as her strong work ethic.<br><br>
